Welcome to 42, the mostly harmless spacecraft simulation tool.

See the overview, "42 Overview.pdf", in the Docs folder.

If you're installing on Windows, see the file "Install-msys.txt" in the Docs folder.

Edit your Makefile to set your PLATFORM.

The default folder for inputs and outputs is "InOut".  Look there for sample input files.  "Inp_Sim.txt" is the top-level input file.

The input/output folder may be changed for a sim run by running 42 with an argument.  For example, enter this at the command prompt:
42 Demo

The VisCProj and XcodeProj folders are provided as starting points.  I haven't kept them up to date as 42 has evolved.  The Makefile is current.

There is a Prox Ops window that I had to leave out of the open source distribution for the present.  That's what the PROXOPSFLAG in the Makefile is about.  Check back in a couple months.
